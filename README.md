# Ticketer
##Synopsis
This is a virtual ticket application built on top of a php-mvc skeleton. Users are able to view all events within a one kilometer radius and acquire a ticket for that event. Upon doing so, they are provided with a live ticket count and a password to present in the case the ticket cannot be presented at the event.

##Usage
A live demo of this application can be viewed at http://ticketer.Donald-Ngai.com
Note: there will most likely not be any events shown as there would not be any events near your current location.

##Motivation
This project was created during the 2014 Hack The North when my hacking partner and I realized how inefficient waiting in line at a hackathon is. The problem could be solved with this application as every contestant in the hackathon has easy access to the internet hence access to the application.
